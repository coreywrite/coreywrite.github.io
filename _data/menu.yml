      - title: I'm a linguistics student interested broadly in idiosyncratic and partially productive linguistic phenomena beyond the word-level.  I especially like contemplating data that serve as a kind of stress-test for deap-seated assumptions that linguists tend to make about natural language.
      - title: For example, the lexicon is often taken to be the locus of idiosyncrasy in the linguistic system because it involves an extensive collection of arbitrary form-meaning pairings, whereas the syntactic module is seen as rule-governed and systematic.  I think there's ample data to suggest that this view is overly simplistic and fails to reckon with the sheer abundance of partially productive patterns and semi-arbitrary form-meaning pairings at the phrasal level, e.g. multi-word expressions, or cases where idiosyncratic constructional requirements override lexical requirements, as in [Joey Chestnut on Sunday once again devoured âˆ… his way to a triumphant win], where the normally obligatory direct object of 'devour' is in fact obligatorally dropped when embedded in the so-called X's way construction.
      - title: I also frequently contemplate whether formal linguistics is on a firm-enough epistemological footing or if the field needs to more explicitly embrace gradience, variation, uncertainty, and creative language use, and rely less on introspective judgments cast on decontextualized, disembodied 'vanilla' data to support theories that make far-reaching claims about cognition and the structure of the brain.  Ideally, our best theories should comport with neurological and psycholinguistic results (or at the very least not contradict those results).  I also think that if we're going to truly believe that the theory-du-jour actually does what it says on the tin, so to speak, then the formalism used to express the theoretical statements ought to be sophisticated and mathematically precise enough to robustly allow for computer implementations.
      - title: Take the extant literature on so-called syntactic island effects.  Claims about islands often rely on what appear to be minimal pairs (an acceptable declarative sentence and its unacceptable counterpart involving extraction).  In my view, the extant literature has relied on minimal pairs that are not systematically controlled for semantic, pragmatic, information structural, and processing-related confounds that are significant drivers of acceptability contrasts.
#        - title: I'm currently most interested in linguistic phenomena that serve as a kind of stress-test for some of our most deep-seated assumptions about natural languages (the principle of compositionality, the binary nature of grammaticality, etc.)
#      - title:  cases where meanings of whole phrases are not simple functions of the meanings of their constitutent parts -- where analyses in terms of atomistic combination that assume a tight syntax-semantics link are virtually impossible without the positing of empty elements or a rich invisible functional structure -- suggest to me, on both theoretical parsimony and empirical grounds, that constructions (morphosyntactic templates of varying degrees of abstractness that can themselves can contribute meaning) should be considered bonafide linguistic objects in their own right
#      - title: my preferred grammar formalisms are constraint-based surface-based non-derivational ones like <a href='https://hpsg.hu-berlin.de/Projects/HPSG-handbook/'>HPSG</a> and its CxG-inspired offshoot <a href='https://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/pdf/BoasSag-sag-chapter.pdf'>SBCG</a>, <a href='http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/sites/asudeh/pdf/asudeh-toivonen09-lfg-ohla.pdf'>LFG</a>, etc.
